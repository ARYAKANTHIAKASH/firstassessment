1st question
ans
•	 LIST, DICTIONARIES are mutable in nature because while we perform
•	The operations like .append for example l=[] 
•	l.append(0) 
•	After doing the append operation on list the address remains same in both cases, That means an object is said to be mutable when it inserts without changing its memory address
